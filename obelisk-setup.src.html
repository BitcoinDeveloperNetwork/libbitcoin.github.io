    <h2>Quick setup guide</h2>
    <p>Create a blockchain database:</p>
    <pre>
  $ mkdir worker/
  $ cd worker/
  $ mkdir blockchain/
  $ sx initchain blockchain/
    </pre>
    <p>If you have a bitcoind bootstrap.dat (can also be downloaded off the
    PirateBay), then you can bootstrap a blockchain. See libbitcoin/tools/ (run
    'make' and see the bootstrap tool).</p>
    <p>Now start the Bitcoin node which will begin the blockchain download.</p>
    <pre>
  $ screen -S worker
  $ obworker
    </pre>
    <p>Press CTRL-C and wait if you want to stop the worker.</p>
    <p>You can see the output using 'tail -f debug.log'.</p>
    <p>Config files are in /install-prefix/etc/obelisk/</p>
    <p>
Important: each worker needs a separate copy of the blockchain
database. Multiple workers cannot both use a blockchain database at the same time. Stop the
worker, copy the blockchain directory to your other worker and restart
obworker.</p>
    <p>Running multiple workers is good for redundancy in case one crashes or
has problems.</p>
