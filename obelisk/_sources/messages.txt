ZeroMQ is a binary transport library. It accepts char byte arrays.
One call to `socket.send(message)` will send message over the socket.

With ZeroMQ, you send char byte arrays (binary data) over its transport
mechanisms. We can also send sequences of binary data that arrive together
at the same time.

For instance to send some data to a socket we first construct a message:
::

    zmq::message_t message(data.size());
    // Pointer to beginning of message so we can copy data to it.
    uint8_t* message_data = reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(message.data());
    std::copy(data.begin(), data.end(), message_data);

And then we send to the socket.
::

    try
    {
        if (!socket.send(message, 0))
            return false;
    }
    catch (zmq::error_t error)
    {
        BITCOIN_ASSERT(error.num() != 0);
        return false;
    }
    return true;

Note the 2nd argument of :func:`socket_t::send`. By specifying ZMQ_SNDMORE,
we can send a series of messages which are only available to the receiving
end once a message with the 2nd argument set to 0.

Imagine we send 5 messages:
::

    socket.send(msg1, ZMQ_SNDMORE)
    socket.send(msg2, ZMQ_SNDMORE)
    socket.send(msg3, ZMQ_SNDMORE)
    socket.send(msg4, ZMQ_SNDMORE)
    socket.send(msg5, 0)

When the message 5 arrives to the server, then message 1-4 will be available
too for the server to receive. ZeroMQ calls this a *frame*.

Different ZeroMQ socket types can modify the frame by popping off beginning
messages before passing them to the API.

In this document, we will imagine an abstract message type called
:class:`obelisk_message` with the folowing methods.

.. cpp:function:: void obelisk_message::append(part)

   Add a new field to the message.

.. cpp:function:: parts_list obelisk_message::parts()

   Return array of all appended parts.

.. cpp:function:: bool obelisk_message::send(socket)

   Send entire frame to socket ending on last appended part.

.. cpp:function:: bool obelisk_message::recv(socket)

   Receive from the socket until no more messages are available in this frame.

We are able to receive all the messages from a socket until no-more are left
by calling :func:`socket_t::getsockopt` and testing ZMQ_RCVMORE.
::

    int64_t more = 1;
    while (more)
    {
        // ... Receive message from socket.
        // Test if more messages available to receive in this frame.
        size_t more_size = sizeof (more);
        socket.getsockopt(ZMQ_RCVMORE, &more, &more_size);
    }

Request & Reply
===============

The format of request and reply fields are very similar.

============== ====================
Request Fields Type(Size)
============== ====================
destination    worker_uuid(0 or 17)
command        string
id             uint32(4)
data           data
checksum       uint32(4)
============== ====================

`destination` describes which backend worker the load balancer should direct
the message to. If empty, then the load balancer picks a random backend
worker. This should only be set in specific conditions where you want to
avoid race conditions. In general it's better to write more resilient code
that is able to handle asynchronity without demanding total consistency.
The worker_uuid usually should be 17 bytes if specifying a destination.
If not then it is 0 bytes (load balancer selects a worker).

Note: that there is a feature to name the workers. If so, then this field
size can vary depending on the number of bytes needed for the custom
worker_uuid.

`command` is the remote method invoked on the worker.

`id` is a random value chosen by the client for corralating server replies with
requests the client sent.

`data` is the remote method parameter serialized as binary data.

`checksum` is a 4 byte checksum of `data`, calculated using the Bitcoin
checksum method. Checksum = first 4 bytes of `sha256(sha256(data))`.

============== ====================
Reply Fields   Type(Size)
============== ====================
origin         worker_uuid(0 or 17)
command        string
id             uint32(4)
data           data
checksum       uint32(4)
============== ====================

The only difference with replies, is the first field indicates which worker
responded back. This is useful for if we want to batch a series of requests
to the same worker. An example might be subscribing to an address, and fetching
the history for the same address. Such an operation should be called on the
same worker to guarantee against a race condition.

But this feature should not be abused. Taking the example futher, if we are
iterating a list of addresses in a wallet, we should **not** be sending all
requests to the same worker, overloading the same worker with operations that
aren't interlinked.
