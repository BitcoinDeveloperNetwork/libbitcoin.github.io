      <h2>Dark Wallet is a new lineage</h2>

        <p>We love Bitcoin, and the power it gives for trade and social connections.
        There is so much untapped power in Bitcoin. You know the saying "we only use 10% of our brain's power"?
        We probably use less than 1% of what is possible with Bitcoin!</p>

        <p>We want to start with a simple premise: Bitcoin in your browser. We want a beautiful experience
        with privacy features built in by default.</p>

        <p>This wallet will serve as a platform or a starting codebase to deliver a high quality Bitcoin
        that serves you, the users.</p>

        <p><b>When will Heml.is be released?</b><br>

        The simple answer is, when it's done. We will of course release 
it as fast as possible, as we want this ourselves! You can follow the 
development on our <a href="http://hemlismessenger.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> plus <a href="http://twitter.com/hemlismessenger" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://facebook.com/hemlismessenger" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>

        <p><b>How much will the app cost?</b><br>
        The application will be free and can always send text messages. 
We will however charge a small fee  (via an in-app purchase) to unlock 
certain features. Exactly which features is to be determined at a later 
time. We do this to fund the continuing development and infrastructure. 
As we said, we will never introduce ads or selling your data to fund the
 app.</p>

         <p><b>Will it be Open Source?</b><br>
         We have all intentions of opening up the source as much as 
possible for scrutiny and help! What we really want people to understand
 however, is that Open Source in itself does not guarantee any privacy 
or safety. It sure helps with transparency, but technology by itself is 
not enough. The fundamental benefits of Heml.is will be the app together
 with our infrastructure, which is what really makes the system 
interesting and secure.</p>
         
         <p><b>Will you release Hemlis on other platforms?</b><br>
         We will focus on getting the application released for iOS and 
Android. Once we have accomplished that, it’s only natural that we 
expand to other platforms as well.</p>

        <p><b>Is it really secure?</b><br>
        Yes and no. Nothing is ever 100% secure. There will not be any 
way for someone without access to your phone to read anything, but with 
access to your phone they can of course read the messages. Just as they 
can use any other app you have installed.</p>
        
        <p><b>Will the design look like iOS even on Android?</b><br>
        Both apps will have a very similar interface inspired by the 
lightness and simplicity of iOS7. But we do not plan to do an app that 
uses strict standard design as we want a design experience that is 
optimized for messaging.</p>

        <p><b>What kind of users are your target?</b><br>
        In short, everyone. One of the key points of Heml.is is to make 
the app as user friendly as possible so as to remove the high threshold 
that is usually associated with encryption software and services.</p>
        
        <p><b>Your server only?</b><br>
        Yes! The way to make the system secure is that we can control 
the infrastructure. Distributing to other servers makes it impossible to
 give any guarantees about the security. We’ll have audits from trusted 
third parties on our platforms regularily, in cooperation with our 
community.</p>

    <div class="span5 offset1 text-left">
      <small>
        <p><b>Why is Heml.is different from WhatsApp, MessageMe, iMessage etc?</b><br>
        Our focus is your privacy so we are building everything from software to company structure to protect that.</p>
        
        <p><b>Does Heml.is save every message on a server?</b><br>
        Messages will only be stored on our end until they have been 
delivered to the recipient. We might add support for optional expiry 
times to messages, in which case messages would be stored until they had
 been delivered or they expire. Whichever comes first.</p>

        <p><b>Can I invest in Heml.is?</b><br>
        If you are talking about investing money for equity and/or 
control. To guarantee the safety of our users we can not accept any 
money “with strings attached”. If you want to give us money anyway, we'd
 love to have them. For a really large amount we will find a cool way to
 show you just how grateful we are.</p>
        
        <p><b>What technology will Heml.is use?</b><br>
        We are building Heml.is on top of proven technologies, such as XMPP with PGP.</p>
        
        <p><b>Why not use OTR?</b><br>
        Even though we love OTR it’s not really feasible to use in a 
mobile environment. The problem is that OTR needs both parties to be 
online for a session to start, but a normal phone would not always be 
online. It would not work at all for offline messages neither.</p>

        <p><b>Will you provide an API and/or allow third party clients?</b><br>
        At this point we don’t see how that would be possible without compromising the security, so for now the answer is no.</p>

        <p><b>Can I e-mail you?</b><br>
        Yes, press(at)heml.is &amp; hello(at)heml.is</p>

        <p><b>Why the name?</b><br>
        Hemlis means "Secret" in Swedish. And .is is the top level 
domain of Iceland, a small but beautiful nation in northern europe - 
quite close to Sweden! The Icelanders are famous for data protection and
 it's one of few top level domains that has proven that they do not cave
 in to pressure easily.</p>

        <p><b>Who is doing this?</b><br>
        Heml.is is built by Peter Sunde (<a href="http://twitter.com/brokep" target="_blank">@brokep</a>), Leif Högberg (<a href="http://twitter.com/leihog" target="_blank">@leihog</a>) &amp; Linus Olsson (<a href="http://twitter.com/bonq" target="_blank">@bonq</a>).</p>

        <p><b>Why are you doing this?</b><br>
        Primarily the leak from Edward Snowden made us understand that 
this is needed. We don’t want a world where everyone is monitored all 
the time. People have a right to be private and this is our way of 
enabling them.</p>
